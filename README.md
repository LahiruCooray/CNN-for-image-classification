# CNN-for-image-classification

For the implementation, our team used Python Programming language with Tensorflow and
Keras. This was due to TensorFlow and Keras simplify building and training CNNs, support data
augmentation, give pre-trained models for transfer learning and can integrate easily with tools like
Matplotlib for visualizing training and validation metrics.

Chosen Data set: RealWaste from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

 Our obejctive is to create a simple CNN that can classify the images into these 9 categories.


- **Team Contributions**:
  - We divided the assignment two sections, **Custom CNN creation and comparison with SOTA networks** wihtin the team members and have created two seperate codes for the sections.
  - These are named "....."

- **GitHub Updates**:
  - Discarded some codes due to errors or poor accuracy.
  - Final and correct Jupyter Notebook files are within the main.py
