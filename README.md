# CNN-for-image-classification

We used Python with TensorFlow and Keras for their ease in building and training CNNs, support for data augmentation, pre-trained models, and integration with visualization tools like Matplotlib.

**Chosen Data set**: RealWaste from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

 Our obejctive is to create a simple CNN that can classify the images into these 9 categories.

# Please Note: 
- **Team Contributions**:
  - We divided the assignment two sections, **Custom CNN creation and comparison with SOTA networks** wihtin the team members and have created two seperate codes for the sections.
  - These are named "....."

- **GitHub Updates**:
  - Discarded some codes due to errors or poor accuracy.
  - Final and correct Jupyter Notebook files are within the main.py
